# v1

__Tiny Reactors v1.0__ is named as such as it involves an entire rewrite, from the ground up, of the _Tiny Reactors_ content.  As the mod has naturally grown, with content tagged on randomly and sporadically, the source has become a network of interconnected classes that make it impossible to easily add/remove reactor structure blocks.

This branch is a direct continuation of _Tiny Reactors_ and will, hopefully in the near future, replace the 1.12.2 branch as the default branch.  The Minecraft CurseForge page will be unaffected and end users will see no difference between either branch.  This new branch, however, gives me a chance to take a top-down approach to the mod and make it as efficient, performance- and code-wise, as possible.
